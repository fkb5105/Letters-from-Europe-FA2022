               BRAKANES. (BOATS FOR HOTEL GUESTS. SWIMMING. TEMP. 66
               At breakfast I collected a little assortment of cracker
               for the trip this P.M.(as one never can be sure where
               we eat next on these trips.)We wandered down to the <span class="corr" title="miss text">doc</span>
               and watched a lot of women buying fish from a fish <span class="corr" title="miss text">wag</span>
                Bought myself a pair of scissors- and a straw basket
               to carry my paints in. Back to the <span class="corr" title="spell err">hotell</span>
               and Gail went
               swimming<span class="corr" title="spell err">-tempture 66 </span>Then we suddenly decided we
               might
               as well get off on the 12.30 <span class="corr" title="spell err">ferryinstead</span> of waiting <span class="corr" title="miss text">fo</span>
               the 5 o'clock which would only bring us into <span class="corr" title="miss text"></span>so

               S we hustled around- Otto had let some shirts go to
               the laundry- but <span class="corr" title="spell err">the</span> rushed around and
               finished them.
               The <span class="corr" title="spell err">feryy</span> was the "Folgefonn" Very nice

               than an hour. Not many people on board and about eight
               cars. We rather hated to leave <span class="corr" title="spell err"><span class="place">Ulrik</span></span>. The hotel
               Brakanes is said to be the best in Norway.It was warm
               and lovely- people lying <span class="corr" title="spell err">about</span> on the
               grass-having tea etc. The re is a little bath shed with compartment
                and curtains along the edge of the terrace.All very
               casual and quite delighttul
               The drive was along the edge of the Hardanager
               <span class="corr" title="spell err">Fjoud</span>. The largest and deepst of them all.Some places were very
               rocky- the road being blasted out of the
               rock. Beautiful waterfalls- some tunnels to pass <span class="corr" title="miss text">thro</span>
