               AUGUST 23rd
               
                At breakfast a HUGE Smorgesbrot
               Everything <span class="corr" title="spell err">imagineable</span>
               <span class="corr" title="miss text">onthe</span> big
               table.Even <span class="corr" title="miss text">picklescheese</span>, <span class="corr" title="spell err">jelliez</span>, salads. cold cuts <span class="corr" title="miss text">etc
                  e</span>
               I painted a little on my glacier'<span class="corr" title="spell err"></span> Went along the dock
               and up the road to Anna Mundel's after seeing her sign 
               
               <span class="corr" title="spell err">Handwerk</span>. 8 mts. 8 minutes. I get a
               sweater and two wool 
               
               <span class="corr" title="spell err">scarbes</span>. Then we returned- stopping at
               an artists pretty 
               house- things for <span class="corr" title="overlap">sale</span> in the studio.Cards
               folders etc.
               A very noisy dog- white Spitz with bad manners barked
               at us. Gail then went swimming. Pretty
               Doodle depicting a figure, presumed Gail, diving into water
               
               <span class="corr" title="spell err">cocold</span>. But she said it was wonderful
               And
               went in and out several <span class="corr" title="miss text">imes</span>.
               I painted <span class="corr" title="miss text">somemore</span>. After lunch we got a hotel
                hoteldory- placed by the little dock for use
               of hotel guests- and rowed about a little.
               Pieces of rope to hold the oars and such narrow blades
               on the oars
               Doodle depicting two figures rowing a boat
                After dinner Otto
               drove us up the pretty
               narrow road beyond the hotel.Very
               nice houses on both sides of the
               
               <span class="corr" title="spell err">raod</span>. I suppose they are summer
               residences for people from <span class="place">Oslo</span>
               or other places. At least some of them looked so
               Had the green duffle bag in and did a tall job <span class="corr" title="miss text">repackin</span>

               After another <span class="corr" title="spell err">sumtous</span>
               <span class="corr" title="overlap">breakffast</span> we started off on the
               10.30 ferry boat.The manager <span class="corr" title="spell err">nad</span> his wife
               were on the
               dock and waved <span class="corr" title="miss text">goodby</span>. A little 2 1/2
               year old boy
               was helping his father push a low cart up the incline to
               the hotel
               Doodle depicting a cart with a figure on either end.
               Noticed again the orange salt water
               rock sea <span class="corr" title="spell err">week</span> along the edges of the
               
               <span class="corr" title="spell err">fjo yd</span>. 13 car <span class="corr" title="spell err">encluding</span> one tank
               truck on the ferry.Conversed with

               her brother Mr Clothier.She from BrynMahr.
               Arrived <span class="place">Grinde</span> at 11.45.Drove along until we came to a 
               little ferry- went across the water by aid of wire ropes.
               We <span class="corr" title="overlap">couldn 't</span> get on But <span class="corr" title="spell err">ti</span> came directly ba ck for us.
               It was getting late for lunch but I had my coat

               On trips everyone is advised to wear a <span class="corr" title="spell err">caot</span>
               with big pockets for this purpose. We drove
               along the edge of the largest <span class="corr" title="spell err">fjoyd</span>-
               like a big lake
               lake.It is also the deepest.About further to the sea.
               About 3000 feet deep. Lots of sea gulls about.
               Very few cars on the road. Drivers very polite
