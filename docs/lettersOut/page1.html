               Departed from <span class="place">Loen</span> about 9. With a picnic. Went <span class="corr" title="miss text">Ea_t</span>for
               a few miles - Toward the glacier where we were yesterday.
               Then north and east around the end of the Nord Fjord
               passing little clusters ofhouses. Edges of bright orange
               seaweed along the edges of the water. The water is a bit
               salt and sea gulls skim about. Even tho it is many
               miles from the Sea. Beautiful vista- across the water.
               Road winding <span class="corr" title="spell err">allng</span><p class="hide">along</p> the <span class="corr" title="spell err">wates</span><p class="hide">waters</p> edge.
               Doodle on left side of page depicting a rough sketch of a house with trees on the
               roof. It is captioned "Grass on Roof-Tops and Trees". 
               Thro <span class="place">Utvik</span> Went high up thro pine

               and THERE were my glasses exactly where
               I had dropped the from my lap as I got
               out ofthe car to take a <span class="corr" title="miss text">pictu_e ofth</span><p class="hide">picture</p>

               Stopped at a little village by a rushing frothy river,
               and bought some soft drinks from a pretty round faced girl
               Again went very high over a mountain range- with grand
               views Carpets of fern. Photographed a very WIDE waterfall
               At the summit we got out and waited <span class="corr" title="spell err">zwhile</span><p class="hide">a while</p> until
               the spark plugs were cleaned. It was a sort of rest place
               A very rough sketch is located on the right side of the page. It is hard to determine
               what this doodle is depicting. It might be a car on the summit of the mountain.
               People having coffeein the sun. Some of the
               old farms were of intereest- 16 more or less-
               buildings in a group Clear reflections in the river.
               Like glass and yet it is always moving. Often
               great rocks in the river bed where the river
               rushes noisily <span class="corr" title="spell err">thdough</span><p class="hide">through</p>. Brilliant green <span class="corr" title="miss text">iin</span>in<p class="hide"></p>
               the bumpy meadows- like fairy moss. Several cream
               colored ponies stopped us in the road- we got
               out and fed them biscuts '<span class="corr" title="spell err">Luch</span><p class="hide">lunch</p> by the roadside
               from the Hotel Alexandra's nice picnic.

               surrounded by snow capped mountains.
               Two horizontal lines with two figures on top of them. The caption reads "Two black
               kid on wall by the roadside". The figures appear to have four legs, so it is assumed
               that the "kid"s are baby goats.
