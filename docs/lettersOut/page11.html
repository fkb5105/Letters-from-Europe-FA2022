               <span class="place">Stalheim</span> and go on. As nothing much to do here
               except look at the views <span class="corr" title="spell err">nd</span> CLIMB about. Had the usual
               <span class="corr" title="spell err">heary</span> laden <span class="corr" title="spell err">Smorgesbrod</span>-but this time with <span class="corr" title="spell err">nohest</span> to
               goodness electric toaster- so we had TOAST. We strolled
               around and went into the 'pill box" the Germans had
               built in a spot overlooking everything. Peeked into the
               so called museum- three little wooden houses grass roofs.
               filled with old wooden farm shovels, , buckets etc.It <span class="corr" title="spell err">wou ld</span>
               
               <span class="corr" title="miss text">notbe</span> open until 11 and anyway we have, by now, seen a
               number of these museums and <span class="corr" title="miss text">somemvery</span> fine ones.
               Sat on the terrace and talked with Mrs. Maxwell- Mr
               Clothier was out for a walk with three sturdy English girl <span class="corr" title="miss text"></span>
               girls.These girls walked 7 miles yesterday
               So we departed with a lunch, about noon. Southward.
               Huge blue busses were continuely wheeling up to the
               hotel before we left. Some having met the steamers
               and others coming over the roads from quite some distance.
               Along by the edge of the <span class="corr" title="spell err">fjoyd</span> we stopped to fish and
               to have <span class="corr" title="spell err">out</span> lunch. The lunch was HORRIBLE bad meat. I hope
               we don't catch anything from the one bite.Also no, fish.
               But a lovely place near some low water falls.
               But the little Sunkist oranges were all right

               To the left depicts three figures with rakes
               People in the fields raking up the hay.
