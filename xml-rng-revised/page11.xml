        <l n="14"/>girls.These girls walked 7 miles yesterday
        <l n="15"/>So we departed with a lunch, about noon. Southward.
        <l n="16"/>Huge blue busses were continuely wheeling up to the
        <l n="17"/>hotel before we left. Some having met the steamers
            and <l n="18"/>others coming over the roads from quite some distance.
        <l n="19"/>Along by the edge of the <corr type="spell err">fjoyd</corr> we stopped to fish and
        <l n="20"/>to have out lunch. The lunch was HORRIBLE bad meat. I hope
        <l n="21"/>we don't catch anything from the one bite.Also no, fish.
        <l n="22"/>But a lovely place near some low water falls.

        <l n="32"/>People in the fields <l n="33"/>raking up the hay.
        <l n="34"/>They do it three <l n="35"/>in a row and rake in unison. <l n="36"/>Smart , Voss, where we turned
